This is the updated version of my professional portfolio. It contains a description of myself, including my background, strengths and technical skills. There is a separate page that displays recent projects, each actively linked so they may be explored individually. There is also a contact page containing the links for my gitHub and LinkedIn pages, as well as my  gmail address. <br>
